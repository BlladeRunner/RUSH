            <h2>What is a Beat</h2>
            <img src="/img/beatsample.jpg">
            <p>
                In <em>music</em> and <em>music theory</em>, the <strong>beat</strong>
                is the basic unit of time, the pulse (regularly repeating event), of the mensural level (or
                <strong>beat</strong> level).
                The <strong>beat</strong>
                is often defined as the rhythm listeners would tap their toes to when listening to a piece of music,
                or the numbers a musician counts while performing, though in practice this may be technically incorrect 
                (often the first multiple level).
                In popular use, <strong>beat</strong> can refer to a variety of related concepts, including pulse,
                tempo, meter, specific rhythms, and groove.<br>
            
                It’s a way that musicians count the notes being played to stay in synch with each other,
                and is often associated with the pulse that listeners tend to feel in the music.
                That is to say, when one is to clap along or dance with the music, they are moving to the beat.
                Songs are made up of three basic components: harmony, melody, and beat.
                The harmony and melody create the sounds in a song, while beat is the basic unit of time in a song—or
                the length pf the notes—that creates rhythm and somewhat affects the speed or tempo of a song.
                Beat is a unique part of music because it refers to several aspects of a song. In popular use, it simply is rhythm.
                For instance, when thinking of a song, you might hum along with it (that would be the melody),
                or you might like the way the song makes you feel (which is usually the way the melody is set against the harmony).
                However, do you find yourself at times clapping your hands along with a song?
                Or stomping your foot? That is considered the beat.
                Beat is most associated with drummers or other percussion players. It’s as if they oversee the beat!
                While all instruments that produce musical notes – the keyboards, string instruments, wind instruments
                and brass –work to create the harmony, melody, and beat, it’s the percussion instruments that are focused on the beat.
            </p=>
            <h2>Why is a Beat Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Beat is a key component of music.
                Without beat there is no way to tell how fast to play the song. Often the beat is established
                on-the-fly by one of the musicians who may just count out “1-2-3-4” so all the musicians know the speed to play at.
                This is typical when a band is performing live, or some musician friends are just jamming and having fun.
                Otherwise the sheet music or the conductor sets the tempo.
                Regardless of how it is done, somehow the tempo or beat is established before the music can be played.
                Imagine if each instrument was playing at a different speed. It would be chaotic.
                Some players would finish before others. Any sense of the harmony would be gone.
                It could and probably would just sound like noise. The harmony would be lost because the simultaneous playing of
                the notes that produce the harmony would no longer be simultaneous!
                For example, a chord structure of the notes F-A-C  is usually played together to produce the F major chord – but
                if the instruments playing these notes together “at the same time” were no longer playing them at the same time,
                the F major chord would not be played.
                An example of hearing instruments play without any beat is demonstrated when an orchestra is tuning up.
                Although this can actually sound pleasant, it is just the sound of instruments playing,
                with no structure of a piece of music.<br><br>

            <h2>How Does Beat Work?</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, the time signature indicates the beat of a song. Using 4/4 time, the graphic below will help explain more.
            </p>    
                <img src="/img/graphic.jpg" style="width:924px; height:100px; margin-top: 60px;">
            <p>    
                You know this is a song written in 4/4 because:
                The time signature at the left has two fours, one over the other
                There are 4 beats in each measure of the music
                The beats are made up of notes with different duration. There are whole notes, half notes, and quarter notes.
                The first note you see is a half note – it has a hollow circle with a line coming out of the circle.
                Half notes are worth two beats. In the first measure the half note is followed by two quarter notes.
                A quarter note looks just like the half note, except the circle is filled in. Quarter notes are worth one beat each.
                A whole note is a hollow circle with no line, and is worth 4 quarter note beats.
                All together then, in the first measure, the one half note and two quarter notes equal a total of four beats.
                In the second measure, the 4 quarter notes equal to 4 beats, and in the same way, the rest of the measures also equal to 4 beats.
            </p>
            <h2>Types of Beats</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Down-beat</strong>: Beats have two components – the down-beat and the up-beat.
                The down-beat is best understood by clapping your hands along with a song. You are clapping the down-beats.<br>

                <strong>Up-beat</strong>: An up-beat is the part of the rhythm that occurs in between the down beats.
                When clapping along with music, an upbeat is timed with when you pull your hands away from each other.<br>

                <strong>Stressed beat</strong>: The beat that is given emphasis, be that it is a little stronger, louder, or in some way stands out from the other beats.
                It is often (but not always) the first beat in a measure of music.<br>

                <strong>Non-stressed beat</strong>: The opposite of a stressed beat. Often a song is filled with more non-stressed beats.
                For example, when the first beat in a 4/4 measure is emphasized, the other three beats are non-stressed.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>How to Identify Beats in Music</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>When Reading Music:</strong><br>
                There are slow songs, and there are fast ones.
                The speed can be indicated by either a metronome, or by using traditional Italian music
                terms such as Andante or Moderato, although there are many others.<br>

                Andante indicates a tempo of a moderately slow beat. Think of the speed at which you take a gentle walk.

                Here is the other way of showing the tempo of a beat. A quarter note is given a number. This number is the setting on a metronome: 120.

                Metronomes are devices that literally keep the beat by making a repetitive sound based on the speed setting of the metronome.<br>
                A great way to see how this works is to visit an online metronome web site, such as this one
                <a href="https://www.flutetunes.com/metronome/" target="_blank" style="color:#000; font-size:16px;" class="metronome">metronome.</a>
            </p=>
            <h2>When Listening to Music:</h2>
            <p>
                Taking beat a bit further, let’s discuss emphasis. We tend to emphasize the downbeats. 
                Imagine you are walking while listening toa favorite song. 
                If your walking is timed with the beats, then each time your foot touches 
                the ground you timed it with a downbeat in the music.
                When you raise your feet you are timing with the upbeat. 
                So literally the image of something going down and up is helpful to understand downbeats and upbeats.<br><br>

                Here is a video of a drummer explaining this:<br>
            </p>    
                <iframe height="300" width="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEoZJlvr0r8" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">

            <p>    
                Putting the emphasis on certain downbeats (or even upbeats) will alter the feel of the music. When counting beats in 4/4 time,
                we might emphasize the first downbeat. 
                Imagine counting in a way in which we say one number louder than the other numbers.
                For example, saying “ONE – two – three -four.”<br><br>  
                It is very common to emphasize the first downbeat. A good practice is to try emphasizing
                other downbeats, or even more than one. As an example, it is also common to emphasize the first and third beats.<br>
                In saying this out loud, it would sound like “ONE – two -THREE – four.”<br><br>

                To fully capture the downbeats and the upbeats try saying it like this: “One – and – two – and – three – and – four -- and.”
                Using this approach, you can emphasize any combination of downbeats or upbeats.
                Try placing the emphasis on the first and third upbeats. This would be “one – AND – two – and – three – AND – four -- and.”<br><br>

                This can get tricky to achieve. Yet practice will get you closer to doing it in a correct way.<br>

                Closing this lesson on beats, here is a video from a percussion specialist in which he shows just how to understand and emphasize
                the upbeats. He’s got rhythm!<br>
